1. Open MySQL Workbench: Launch the MySQL Workbench application on your computer.

2. Connect to your MySQL Server: Connect to the MySQL Server instance where you want to import the SQL file. You can do this by clicking on the '+' icon next to "MySQL Connections" in the home screen of MySQL Workbench and entering the necessary connection details like hostname, port, username, and password.

3. Open SQL Editor: Once connected, click on the SQL Editor icon in the top-left corner of the MySQL Workbench window. This will open a new SQL Editor tab.

4. Load SQL File: In the SQL Editor tab, click on the 'Open SQL Script' icon or go to File > Open SQL Script from the menu. Browse to the location of your SQL file, select it, and click 'Open'.

5. Review SQL Script (Optional): If you want, you can review the contents of the SQL file in the SQL Editor before executing it. This can be helpful to ensure that the SQL script contains the commands you expect.

6. Execute SQL Script: Once you're ready to import the SQL file into your MySQL database, click on the lightning bolt icon in the toolbar of the SQL Editor. This will execute the SQL commands in the script.

7. Monitor Progress: Depending on the size of the SQL file and the complexity of the commands it contains, the import process may take some time. You can monitor the progress of the execution in the Output panel at the bottom of the MySQL Workbench window. Any errors encountered during the execution will also be displayed here.

8. Verify Import: After the execution is complete, you can verify that the SQL file was imported successfully by querying the database tables or running other commands as needed.
